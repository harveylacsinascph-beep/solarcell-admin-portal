PAGES TO UPDATE WITH API INTEGRATION:

✅ DONE:
- employee.html ✓ (loads from /api/employees)
- attendance.html ✓ (added api-config.js)
- add-employee.html ✓ (already working)

⏳ STILL NEED UPDATE (script sections only):

1. leave.html
   - Load from: await leaveAPI.getAll()
   - Display: start_date, end_date, leave_type, reason, status

2. login.html  
   - Load from: await tapLogAPI.getAll()
   - Display: barcode, name, timestamp

3. manage-employee.html
   - Load from: await employeeAPI.getAll()
   - Add delete button functionality
   - Display: barcode, name, position, department, actions

4. no-show.html
   - Filter employees with no recent tap_logs
   - Load from: await employeeAPI.getAll() + tap_logs

5. schedule.html
   - Load from: await scheduleAPI.getAll()
   - Display: title, description, event_date

6. id.html
   - Load from: await employeeAPI.getAll()
   - Generate barcodes from barcode field

7. Dashboard.html
   - Load stats from API
   - Load announcements from: await announcementAPI.getAll()

TO COMPLETE THESE FAST:
1. I can provide the JavaScript code for each page
2. You copy-paste into the corresponding page's <script> section
3. Replace the static data with API calls

Would you like me to:
A) Provide all the code ready to copy-paste
B) Do them one by one
C) Automatically update all remaining pages
